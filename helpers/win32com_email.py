win32com_email.py

Utilities to send notifications via Outlook using the pywin32/win32com
automation interface.

This module provides a small wrapper to build and send emails (or display
them interactively) using Outlook.

Dependencies:
    - pywin32 (win32com)

# NOTE: Validation bug - the code currently uses `isinstance(bcc, str)` when
# NOTE: `bcc` should be a list of strings. Validate the container type and
# NOTE: each email address. Separate message construction from sending so
# NOTE: message text can be unit-tested without Outlook. Avoid calling
# NOTE: `sys.exit()` inside library functions; raise exceptions so callers
# NOTE: can decide how to recover or exit.
