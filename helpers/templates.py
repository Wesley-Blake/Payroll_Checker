Hi,

Friendly Reminder: Overtime Not Allocated

We wanted to let you know that you recorded more than 8 hours of regular (7.5 for union) time in a single day, and overtime has not yet been allocated.

For helpful guidance, you can review the overtime rules here: https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_Overtime.htm
Essentially, you should put 8 (7.5 union) in Regular Earnings, the rest goes in Overtime.

Hi,

Friendly Reminder: Overtime for Hours Over 12 Not Allocated

We wanted to share a quick reminder that any hours worked over 12 in a single day (regular + overtime) are automatically considered OT2 and may need to be allocated accordingly.
For more information, you can review the guidelines here: https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_Overtime.htm
Example:
8 REG (7.5 union) + 4 OT (4.5 union) = 12 hours and everything else is in OT2.

Hi,

We noticed that there are some hours on your timesheet that overlap. This happens from time to time and can usually be resolved with a quick review.
Additionally, if you are using the Employee Services (new), the yellow (!) will tell you specifics.
